            <h2><u>Working model :</u></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Core Components:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><h4><u>Asymmetric key Cryptography:</u></h4>
                            <p>The blockchain network utilizes the capabilities of public key cryptography for secure operation of the blockchain. To perform any exchange, other than being on the same platform, the users need to possess a digital wallet (functioning like a bank account) secured with the user’s private key, and accessible with appropriate signatures generated using that private key. This wallet’s public key  serves as  the bitcoin address known to everyone, which is advised to change with each transaction for maintaining privacy and anonymity of users.  Private keys are used to digitally sign transactions and are kept secret by the user. </p></li>
                            <li><h4><u>Transactions:</u></h4>
                                <p>The Blockchain enables the sharing and exchange of information among nodes on a peer-to-peer basis. This  exchange takes place  by means of files containing transfer information from one node  to the other, generated by a source node and broadcasted to the entire network for validation. The current state of blockchain is represented by these transactions, which are continuously generated by the nodes, and then congregated in blocks. In the case of bitcoin, each transaction represents the transfer of currency from one node to the other. All nodes are aware of the current balance at each address and maintain a copy of the existing blockchain, which is the log containing the history of previous transactions. The state of the blockchain changes after each transaction. With a huge number of transactions generated each second, it is very important to validate and verify the genuine ones and discard the fake.</p></li>
                                <li><h4><u>Consensus Mechanism:</u></h4>
                                    <p>When nodes begin data sharing and exchanging via a blockchain platform, they don’t have a centralized party to regulate and resolve disputes or safeguard against security violations and a mechanism to keep track of the flow of funds and ensure an unassailable exchange to avoid fraud, such as double spending attacks is  needed.  All  nodes  should  agree  on  a common content updating protocol for this ledger, to maintain  a  consistent  state  and  blocks  should  not simply be  accepted to  be  a part of the blockchain, without majority consent.
                                        <div class="text-center"><img src="images/con1.jpg" class="rounded" alt="sampleimage2" width="425" height="300"></div><br>
                                        <strong><u>This is called a consensus mechanism</u></strong> by which blocks are created and added to the existing ledger for future use. In the case of bitcoin the  recipients,  after  signature  verification,  might redeem outputs multiple times for use in subsequent transactions as they would seem valid by individual recipients.  Thus,  solely  for  avoiding  the  double spending,  Satoshi  was  the  first  one  to  propose  a consensus based decentralized cryptocurrency among non-trusted nodes.  This consensus is an  agreement amongst  the  nodes,  which  involves  block  mining, wherein miners compete to find the next valid block by computing a cryptographic block hash. Nodes finding the solution are rewarded with some bitcoins, thereby generating new currency. This hash value is called ‘the proof of work’ and if all transactions and proof-of-work are valid, the nodes accept it by updating their copy. </p></li>

                                        <dt>Consensus, mining and block validation: </dt>
                                        <dd>Nodes, in the absence of a trusted party follow a consensus on how to confirm or discard blocks and transactions with mutual effort so that there aren’t any conflicts at a later stage. This consensus in bitcoin is achieved by ‘proof-of-work’ which proves how  much work has been put  in for validating a block. A cryptographic puzzle is to be solved for acceptance  of any  block  and its  addition  in the  shared ledger. This  works by  nodes accumulating the  verified transactions in a block and putting their resources (such as computation power and electricity) to find a value that makes the SHA-256 hash value of this block less than a dynamically varying target value. The block contents include, the arbitrary nonce, hash of the previous block, Merkle root hash of the listed transactions, timestamp and block version. The term ‘proof-of-work’ refers to this random value which is found by the miners, by repeatedly hashing the block contents with many such random values to achieve the Cryptographic block hash. </dd>
